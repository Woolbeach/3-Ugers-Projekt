2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
DPIP-1#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP Inst_student_code/Inst_lc3_computer/lc3_m/lc3_1/Mmult_n0620 input Inst_student_code/Inst_lc3_computer/lc3_m/lc3_1/Mmult_n0620/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#2 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP Inst_student_code/Inst_lc3_computer/lc3_m/lc3_1/Mmult_n0620 input Inst_student_code/Inst_lc3_computer/lc3_m/lc3_1/Mmult_n0620/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP Inst_student_code/Inst_lc3_computer/lc3_m/lc3_1/Mmult_n0620 output Inst_student_code/Inst_lc3_computer/lc3_m/lc3_1/Mmult_n0620/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP Inst_student_code/Inst_lc3_computer/lc3_m/lc3_1/Mmult_n0620 multiplier stage Inst_student_code/Inst_lc3_computer/lc3_m/lc3_1/Mmult_n0620/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

AVAL-4#1 Advisory
enum_USE_DPORT_FALSE_enum_DREG_ADREG_0_connects_CED_CEAD_RSTD_GND  
Inst_student_code/Inst_lc3_computer/lc3_m/lc3_1/Mmult_n0620: DSP48E1 is not using the D port (USE_DPORT = FALSE). For improved power characteristics, set DREG and ADREG to '1', tie CED, CEAD, and RSTD to logic '0'.
Related violations: <none>
